### Task-1: NUMBER GAME
**Overview**
This is a simple Java program where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 100. The program provides hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed. It tracks the number of attempts and allows the player to replay.

**Key Features**
- Random number generation for replayability.
- Feedback on each guess to guide the player.
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Option to play multiple rounds.

**Objective**
A fun way to practice Java basics like loops, conditionals, input handling, and random number generation.




### Task-2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
**Overview**
A simple Java program that calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade based on marks entered for multiple subjects.

**Key Features**  
- Accepts the number of subjects and marks dynamically.  
- Calculates the average percentage.  
- Assigns grades based on the average:  
  - A: 90% and above  
  - B: 80% to 89%  
  - C: 70% to 79%  
  - D: 60% to 69%  
  - F: Below 60%

**Objective**  
An easy-to-use tool to calculate grades and practice basic Java concepts like loops and conditionals.




### Task-3: ATM INTERFACE
**Overview**  
A simple Java program that simulates basic ATM operations like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money.

**Key Features**  
- Check account balance.  
- Deposit and withdraw money with input validation.  
- User-friendly menu for interaction.  
- Runs until the user chooses to exit.
   
**Objective**  
An easy-to-use program to practice object-oriented programming concepts and basic Java features like loops and input handling.  




### Task-5: STUDENT COURSE REGISTRATION SYSTEM

**Overview**  
A simple Java program that allows students to register for courses, drop courses, and view available courses. It manages course capacity and student registrations.

**Key Features**  
- Add courses with details like code, title, and capacity.  
- Register students for courses if capacity allows.  
- Drop courses for students.  
- Display available courses with current enrollment.  
- Menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

**Objective**  
To practice object-oriented programming concepts and build a functional course registration system.
